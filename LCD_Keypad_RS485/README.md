# Description
It is a proof of concept. The device has a LCD screen with 2 lines by 16 characters and a flat numeric keypad. What we write on the keyboard appears on the screen.
The "#" button is used to erase the screen.
The device has 2 cables to connect to the RS-485 bus. When data is received via the bus, the device displays them on the screen.
