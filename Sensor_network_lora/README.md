# Description
The goal is for 3 devices, each with a different type of sensor, to send RF measurements to a fourth device that shows them by serial port.
There are 4 devices available. They are labeled for identification:
Gateway
• Receives RF data from the sensors and displays them by serial port.
• In a next step you are expected to send this data via SIMCOM.
Multisensor (BMP-180, 811v1)
• Send by RF the data of 2 sensors in their respective magnitudes:
or Co2 (ppm)
or TVOC (ppb)
o Temperature (Celsius degrees)
o Atmospheric pressure (millibars)
33 (MQ-135)
• Send a voltage value by RF. It corresponds to the detected gas and its concentration.
34 (MQ-7)
• Send a voltage value by RF. It corresponds to the detected gas and its concentration.
